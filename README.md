**`roverd` is an always running process on the rover (daemon) which exposes endpoints that allow programs like `roverctl` to interact with the rover. This repo also defines the API specification which clients need to implement in order to use the provided functionality. In short, roverd lets you view system status, upload services and start/stop a collection of services (a pipeline).**
