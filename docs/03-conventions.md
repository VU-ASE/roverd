# Conventions

Roverd looks for some information stored in files on disk. The following are the conventions for filenames and their contents which roverd assumes.


| System Path  | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| `/etc/roverd/roverd.yaml` | YAML file | Main runtime configuration of the rover's pipeline, validated by roverd. |
| `/etc/rover` | Text file | Simple read-only file generated by ansible which has `id`, `rover_name` and `birthdate` separated by newlines |
| `/home/debix/.rover/` | Directory | Main configuration directory containing all services and source code. More detailed information below. |


### The `~/.rover` Directory

We assume by default all rovers are used with the default `debix` user which means that the placing the `.rover` directory into the home directory of this user will never change. This directory contains all services on the system, regardless of whether they are enabled or not. Each service is fully qualified through the following directory hierarchy:

  

`~/.rover/{author}/{service}/{version}/`

* **author** - For example, all service provided by the ase team will have the github organization name here, so the author in this case would be "vu-ase".
* **service** - The name of a service, for example "controller".
* **version** - The SemVer of the service, for example "0.1.0".
